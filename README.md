simulationCode.m utilizes mcMatlab packages to simulate the Cherenkov emission from tissue for a set wavelength. The source distribution can be defined from a treatment planning system as the dose distrubution of the beam as a 3D matrix. The tissue properties are consistant with typical breast tissue topped with 3cm of air.
